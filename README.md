Hi, I am a husband and a father of two children. I am also a ragdoll cats lover. 

I've spent almost every spare time learning coding for the last 18 months. When I have a break, I spend time with children or run. So far, I have run two street runs, 10 km each.

I am going to learn a CSS framework next - Bootstrap or Materialize.
